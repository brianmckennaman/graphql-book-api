# GraphQl Api Assignment

The goal of this assignment was to take starter code for a book search app, and refactor it to utilize GraphQl and Apollo server funcionality. 

First, I cloned the starter code from the original repo, then began work on refactoring the code.

This involved adding a resolvers.js and typeDefs.js file into the schemas directory on the server side, adding a mutations.js and queries.js file into the utils directory on the client side.

After, I refactored and simplified the submitForm functions to utlize GraphQl syntax, connected to MongoDB Atlas, then deployed the app via Heroku.

A link to the deployed application on Heroku can be found here: https://brians-google-books-api.herokuapp.com/
